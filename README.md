<strong>Pure JavaScript Excel</strong> <br/>
A web-based version of the Excel program in pure JavaScript with no libraries or frameworks.
This application implements text editing in each cell, cell scaling and saving data to local storage.
Almost everything that is now possible to do with popular frameworks, but without them, is done in pure JavaScript, including state management.
